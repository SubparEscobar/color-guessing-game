# 🎨 Color Guessing Game

A fun, interactive browser game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a simple yet polished browser game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected color from a list of HTML color names. After each guess, the player receives a hint based on alphabetical order to help narrow down the answer. Once the correct color is guessed, the background changes to that color and the number of attempts is displayed.

### 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic structure
- **CSS3** — responsive styling
- **Bootstrap 5** — modern UI components and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — game logic and interactivity

## 🎯 Key Features

- Random color selection from a sorted list
- Case-insensitive guessing
- Real-time feedback with hints:
  - "Alphabetically higher/lower" guidance
  - Invalid color name warnings
- Total number of guesses tracked and displayed
- Background dynamically changes to the guessed color on success
- Clean and modern layout styled with Bootstrap

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
- JavaScript control structures (`do...while`, `if/else`)
- DOM manipulation
- Working with arrays (`sort()`, `includes()`, `join()`)
- GitHub workflow and repository management
- Creating a user-friendly UI with Bootstrap
